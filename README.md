###"Time is money. Learn to touch type now "

#####Qwertyâ„¢  is a completely free service that trains you to become more productive, speeding up your WPM so you can work as fast as your thoughts.

The base of user experience is composed on improving ones typing skill using a desktop/laptop interface ONLY. we tried to make it fun using

Three big tab-buttons in the top-left corner are used for basic program modes: Current lesson, user score, speed and on top right a timer counter to indicate how long you have to complete the content.

In center of a window, the text to be typed is displayed. The counter will start when the first letter is typed. Upon completion of a level the  difficulty will increase going on to the next one. It will also save & populate users progress.

This will help you to learn touch typing with all ten fingers



##Planning

In this project we were assemebled in a group of three as part of a  group project. The requirements of this project were to build an JWT authenticated RESTful MEAN stack application using AngularJS, with a chosen CSS framework.

We came up with a concept of few ideas we wanted to run with and chose QWERTY as our chosen idea for this project.

We spent a couple of days carefully planning our Mongoose models, as they needed to be embedded within each other so that we could link and reference the right data on the front-end.

Tasks were organised and delegated using a Trello board. We had three stand-ups and Git merges  on a daily basis to ascertain what had to be achieved and what still needed to be completed.


##Wire-Frames 

We also collaborated on the using sketch wireframes before starting to code, so that everyone approved the look of the app which also gave us a foundation/ reference of what our interface should portray.

##Challenges

* This was our first experience working within a team. We found some conflicts with our Git commits. In order to overcome we made sure that we were all woking on a different branch and merged to our secondary master branch which we made sure was as up-to-date as possible, with multiple merges per day and many commits.

* We also had a stumbling block with error handling in our registration form as it was not passing the error messages when data was.

* Getting live update of scores for each user on the leader board.

* Alert after level completion

* Taking on a new CSS framework(Tachyons) and manipulate our own style.

##Wins 

Complementing our strengths and weakness as a group. 

Getting the 'hang' of using Git Command in a team

Wrapping the text in Span to make it highlight green for when characters was typed correct and red when typed incorrectly was challenge but was also a great win

```
function splitIntoSpans(text) {
  return text.split('').map(function(n) {
    return '<span>' + n + '</span>';
  }).join('');
}
```
